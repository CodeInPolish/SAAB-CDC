There's a lot of SAAB cars on the streets. Unfortunately back in the day they didn't have means to hook up an MP3 player to them like modern cars have now by default.

BlueSaab (SAAB-CDC) is a CD changer emulator for older SAAB cars (1998-2004) that "pretends" to be the original SAAB CD changer and passes through the audio from any bluetooth audio source. It even enables audio track control via the cars steering wheel controls.
